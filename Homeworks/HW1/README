The challenge of this assignment was, as far as I can remember, to implement
a version of the provided "Set" class using dynamic allocation, and then to
build a secure usage of the Set class for storage of Social Security numbers.

It may also be true that Set.cpp & Set.h were provided in retrospect as a
solution to the assignment; again, I am not sure.

Set.cpp & Set.h contain the provided files; the public portion of the newSet
class declaration was provided as well.

PACKAGE CONTENTS:
Set.cpp:		the provided source code for a Set class
Set.h:			the declaration of the above Set class
testSet.cpp:		a file to test the above Set class
newSet.cpp:		my source code for a dynamically allocated
			Set class
newSet.h:		my declaration of the above Set class
testnewSet.cpp:		a file to test the above Set class
SSNSet.cpp:		my source code for an implementation of
			the new Set class for secure storage
SSNSet.h:		my declaration of the above SSNSet class
testSSNSet.cpp:		my file to test to above SSNSet class
