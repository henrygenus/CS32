A skeleton code was provided for this project; as such, the code for the
following files was not developed by me.

PACKAGE CONTENTS:
Provided Files:
main.cpp:		sets environment and calls the main game loop
GameController.cpp:	implementations for high level gameplay:
			i.e. key interpretation, etc
GameController.h:	declarations for high level gameplay
GameWorld.cpp:		implementation of map functions
GameWorld.h:		declaration of map related functions
SoundFX.h:		declaration of functions related to sound
Level.h:	 	implementations for level file interpretation
GraphObject.h:		implementations for plotting images
Assets/:		images/sounds and level files

My Files:
Actor.cpp:		implementation of game object classes
Actor.h:		declaration of game object classes
StudentWorld.cpp:	implementation of game world
StudentWorld.h:		declaration of game world

Note that inside "main.cpp", the path to assets is hard coded and must
be altered to run correctly.  XQuartz or another similar program is
required.
