This is a collection of projects and homeowork assignments from CS32 with
David Smallberg in winter 2019.

This repository is in progress; the homeworks have not yet been addressed.

Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the specs for projects 1 & 2, so
I can no longer guarentee adherance to the specs; however, I believe these
are still useful as code samples.
