This is a collection of projects and homework assignments from CS32:"Introduction to Computer Science II" with
David Smallberg in winter 2019.

Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the specs for projects 1 & 2, so
I can no longer guarentee adherance to the specs; however, I believe these
are still useful as code samples.

Additionally, I no longer have access to the assignment sheets for any
of the homeworks, nor the assignment for homework 5.  As it did not involve
writing any code, I am not too terribly upset, but we can thank the UCLA
computer science department for deleting my account on that one.
